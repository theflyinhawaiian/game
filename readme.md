# Console Game Playground

This repo is meant to be a blank slate/jumping off point for a console app game, to be used for teaching purposes.

In the future, I may add additional branches to give starting points for specific types of games.

Assumption(s):
- you have .NET tools on your PATH.

Run the following command from your project root in order to run your game:
```
$> dotnet run
```

This will run `Program.cs`'s `main` method.
